# ets2-telemetry-server-enhanced-dashboard
This is a replacement default dashboard for ets2-telemetry-server.

You can find that project here: https://github.com/Funbit/ets2-telemetry-server

I'm using ETS2 with a FOV setting that hides the dashboard while trucking, and I was in need of additional information that's not shown by the default dashboard.
These include:
- parking brake lights
- engine brake lights
- retarder information (on/off, current level)
- wiper (when you try to switch off the wipers rapidly it's easy to cycle through the off state, and I found this annoying, so I added this light too)
- warning lights for oil, water, fuel

Additionally, I added blinking lights to indicate speeding.

I also added some job-related information: time till next stop, remaining time and distance based on current navigation.

# Installation
Simply download as a zip and copy into the folder of the ETS2/ATS Dashboard project
